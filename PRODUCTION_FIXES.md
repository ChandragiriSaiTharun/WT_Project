## 🎯 PRODUCTION FIXES SUMMARY

### ✅ **Issues Fixed**

#### 1. 🖼️ **Crop Images Not Loading**

- **Problem**: Images not displaying for other users
- **Root Cause**: Relative image URLs not working in production
- **Solution**:
  - Modified `crops.js` to generate full URLs with host detection
  - Added CSP headers to allow images from current domain
  - Added dedicated `/crop/:filename` route with proper CORS headers

#### 2. 👤 **My Orders Showing Others' Orders**

- **Problem**: localStorage orders shared across all users
- **Root Cause**: Global localStorage key `userOrders` used for all users
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented user-specific localStorage keys (`userOrders_${userId}`)
  - Added user session validation before loading orders
  - Fixed both `HomePage_DetailsFilling.html` and `order-success.html`

#### 3. 📧 **Email Connection Timeout**

- **Problem**: `Error: Connection timeout` when sending emails
- **Root Cause**: Gmail SMTP blocking/timeout issues
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced email transporter with connection pooling
  - Added safe email sending function with fallbacks
  - Increased timeout values and added retry logic

#### 4. 🔒 **Content Security Policy (CSP) Blocking Images**

- **Problem**: CSP preventing image loading from same domain
- **Root Cause**: Missing/restrictive CSP configuration
- **Solution**:
  - Added dynamic CSP headers allowing images from current domain
  - Added CORS headers for cross-origin image requests
  - Added cache control for better performance

### 🚀 **Deployment Status**

- Render auto-deployment triggered
- Market prices auto-seeding will activate on first API call

### 🧪 **Testing Completed**

2. **Crop Images**: Full URLs working with proper CORS/CSP headers
3. **My Orders**: User-specific orders only (no cross-contamination)
